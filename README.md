 ### Description of the project
Adverse weather conditions, such as rain, snow, fog, and ice, pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles. These conditions can impair the functionality of cameras, LiDAR, and radar sensors, reducing their ability to accurately detect objects, lanes, and road signs. Rain and snow can obscure camera lenses, while fog can reduce visibility for optical sensors. Additionally, slippery roads due to ice or rain can affect the vehicle's control and braking systems, increasing the risk of accidents.

Machine learning models used for decision-making in autonomous vehicles may also struggle in these scenarios due to limited training data for adverse weather. This highlights the importance of robust sensor fusion, weather-specific model training, and redundancy systems to ensure safe and reliable operation under all conditions. The main purpose of this project is to find out the most impactful weather for Autonomous Vehicles.
